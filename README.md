# Noise Recorder

This is a small project designed to make it easy to collect data for noise recognition systems. Records audio from all your microphones at once to maximize the amount of data produced.

Right now it's just infrastructure. The objective is that you should be able to drop this into your Dragonfly or Talon config, to make it easy to record noise data while doing otherwise passive activities (like watching YouTube).
